# Bid 4 meal
Bid 4 meal is a user interface made it in react for select the meal you want in your flight. I create an online json with fake data only to feed and test the app, so it doesn't have a real backend. You have to supose, as a user, that you recibed an email with the personal direct link to the web app.

## Instructions
- 1:
*Clone this repo*
- 2:
*npm install*
- 3:
*npm start*

A window browser open the app. As a user you've recibed a direct link:


## User Story

- See a loading page when the app is charging.

- Click a button to select my meal for every one of my journeys

## Backlog
- Be able to insert mi flight locator and my name and surname to access
