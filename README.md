# Bid 4 meal
Bid 4 meal is a user interface made it in react for select the meal you want in your flight. I create an online json with fake data only to feed and test the app, so it doesn't have a real backend. You have to supose, as a user, that you recibed an email with the personal direct link to the web app.

## User Story
- **As a user I can**: 
- See a loading page when the app is charging.
- See a informative page if an error ocurs.
- Have acces to the app only if I'm allowed
- See a page intro with the information of my flight to verify if is correct
- Click a button to select my meal
- See a list of the meals an his prices
- Select the meal I want in my flight and save it
- Deselect the meal if i'm not sure of my choose and save it, I can do it later.

## Backlog
- Have a small password related to my booking for more security
- Convert the currency to my currency, only cause I don't know the difference with mine and I want to know how much I'm paying.
